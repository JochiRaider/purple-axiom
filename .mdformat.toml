# Enable only the extensions we use and have installed.
# Each extension requires its corresponding mdformat plugin package.
#
# Installed plugins → extension names:
#   mdformat-gfm         → "gfm" (tables, strikethrough, autolinks, tasklists)
#   mdformat-frontmatter → "frontmatter" (YAML frontmatter preservation)
#
# NOTE: Only list extensions for plugins actually in pyproject.toml.
# Adding extensions without the plugin installed causes silent fallback behavior.

  "gfm",
  "frontmatter",
]

# Exclusion patterns must be specified via:
#   - pre-commit hook `exclude:` patterns, or
#   - CLI `--exclude` flag
# Config-file `exclude` requires Python 3.13+ (toolchain is 3.12.3).
